### Program Overview:
This program demonstrates working with classes in Object Oriented Programming.

---

### How to Use the Program:
1. **Normal startup**:  
   Print `make`. After compiling the program with `make`, You will need to run it with ./main.
   
2. **Google Class Testing**:  
   Print `make test`. After compiling the program with `make test`, You will need to run it with ./runTests.
   
3. **Clean Up**:  
   Run `make clean` to remove any temporary files created during execution.

### Explanation of How the Program Works:
1. Overloaded comparison operators (`<`, `>`, `==`, `<=`, `>=`) are implemented for transformers within the same group:
- Comparison by strength (`strength`) and other parameters.
- Different results are displayed via console.
2. Two instances of each class are created (`Autobot`, `Decepticon`, `Microbot`).
3. Unique parameters are set for each instance: name, level, strength, range, weapon, shield and, for microbots, faction.
4. Instances are compared with each other within their group.
5. Comparison results are displayed in console.
